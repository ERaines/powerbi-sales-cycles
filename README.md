# Sales Analysis Report – Power BI Project

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in Power BI and data analysis.
Using fictitious data from the video “Aprenda Power BI do Zero” (From Youtub Channel Daxus), I created an interactive dashboard and a detailed analytical report focused on sales performance and strategic planning.

## Purpose of this project

The goal of this analysis was to:

Identify which products achieved the highest sales throughout the year.

Understand the factors that influenced these results (seasonality, campaigns, regional performance).

Propose strategic actions to improve logistics, marketing, and profitability for the following year.

## Considerations

In addition to building the dashboard, I focused on developing insights  turning data into actionable business recommendations — which is a key skill in data-driven decision-making.
